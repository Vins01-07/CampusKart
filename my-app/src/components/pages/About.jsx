      <p className="about-intro">
        CampusKart isn’t just a marketplace – it’s your <strong>college survival kit</strong>!  
        Imagine a place where you can buy or sell lab coats, drafter kits, calculators, books, 
        and even second-hand electronics, all under one roof. That’s CampusKart.  
        <br /><br />
        Whether you’re a fresher trying to find your first lab coat or a final-year student selling 
        your old drafter, CampusKart helps you save money and pass the legacy on.  
        <br /><br />
        Why spend extra on items you’ll use for only a few semesters when you can get them 
        at half the cost – in great condition? At the same time, selling your old stuff means 
        you’re helping juniors, making extra cash, and promoting sustainability 🌱.  
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Think of CampusKart as the OLX for students – but more fun, colorful, and campus-focused!</strong>
